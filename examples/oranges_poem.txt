Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Here's a poem,
About sharing oranges too.

There were three friends,
Whose names were Ann, Ben, and Sue,
They had 10 oranges,
And didn't know what to do.

Ann suggested they split them,
Equally, three each,
But Ben said that wasn't fair,
As Sue was too weak.

So they decided to give Sue,
An extra orange or two,
And split the rest evenly,
So everyone had a fair view.

And that's how Ann, Ben, and Sue,
Shared their 10 oranges,
With kindness and fairness,
And no one had any grudges.
